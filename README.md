### 24 Hour Design Challenge
##### What: Design and develop a single page landing site for a new movie.
##### Why: To promote the movie and convert users into moviegoers and fans.
##### How: Design and develop a landing page that is engaging and dynamic.
* Initial idea for features
* Hero Image
* Overview/Synopsis
* Trailers
* Movie Tickets
* Interviews
* Cast + Crew abouts/information
I decided to choose the movie Halloween that is scheduled to come out on October 19th 2018 primarily because I love horror movies and am excited to see it. I then searched for the top summer blockbuster films of 2018 to get an idea of what their landing pages were like. Based on my research I chose Avengers Infinity War, Hereditary, and the Incredibles 2. I took screenshots of each site and broke down the layouts to identify commonalities and decide what would be the best approach for my design. What really surprised me was that none of those movies had the option to purchase tickets from the site and since my movie option wasn't coming out until October I decided a better approach would be a "sign up for early access". Based on my evaluation of the three sites I decided on these features.

#### Features
* Single page
* Dynamic hero (either animations or background video)
* Sign-up link/email capture in hero for quick conversion
* Trailer section
* Synopsis/Cast and Crew
* Shop merchandise
* Cast interviews
* Social fan club
* Sketched wireframe

I needed to use a trailer video from youtube but I didnt want all of the controls and visual playbar elements so it took some working in their developer section to get the parameters to align with what I was looking for. I also had to create some workarounds in CSS to get video to be full width and height of the browser. Another challenge was doing on overlay over the video to add the title, date and sign up link. Instead of using the trailers sound I decided to mute the trailer and use the original theme song track using html5 audio element. I was able to code the rest of the layout and used flexbox to align some of the sections. I added sublte transitions to the nav, buttons, and social section. I was unable to code any responsiveness so the site only works in desktop view at this time.

#### Summary
This was challenging because I wanted to make sure that I evaluated the top sites so that I prioritized the most important elements of a movie landing page site that would convert customers. I am glad I chose to add a video background for the hero because with the audio of the theme song playing together creates a suspenseful and engaging experience. I also think adding the social fan club section that would pull images from Instagram would be a great addition to promote the movie and build fans. If I could keep going then I would make it responsive on all devices.
